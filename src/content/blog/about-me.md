## Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Michael Erb.

-- Little intro about me here --

I wanted to create this blog to share my passion for web development and coding in general. Something always held me back though. That pesky impostor syndrom. In this case, that feeling of someone else out there does it better than you. Explains it better, understands it better, and so on. Someone else out there is so much better I should be embaressed to even try to share. Then I came accross this web comic that put it into perspective for me.

If for some reason the image above is not working, the gist is that many of us humans come built in with this pre-conceived notion that we should know a specific amount of things by the time we become "adults". I have seen this in myself even with web dev. Have you ever told yourself or someone "I/you should know this already!". You, my friend, have fallen into that trap.

In reality, we just cannot know everything. We could have never come accross a subject. Or forgotten it. For whatever reason, we cannot be familar with everything. With that said, some days you or I get to be a luck 10,000 and learn something new. In the web industry the math may work out to be more like the lucky 100, lets be honest.

The affect this has had on me is to hold back asking questions in meetings so as to not look like a dumby. We are all dumbys sometimes though, some people just put on a good face for the rest of us. Im not saying we should interupt meetings to ask every question that comes to mind. Instead lets think though these questions. My main take away I want is to not hold yourself back because you think you should already know something. Working on getting over this fear of asking questions over the last several years has helped in countless ways both professionally and personally.

My goal for this blog is to help someone be that lucky 10,000 or how ever the math works out. Another, more selfish, goal is to also allow more people to point out my mistakes or mis-understandings. I definently dont know everything, and I may have some pre-conceived notions about some things myself too. I dont want to go on through life not knowing that! Who would?
